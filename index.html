   <h1>The Most Unforgettable Book "How to Kill My Best Friend"</h1>
    <p>I have finished reading this book, but one particular chapter stands out. It narrates a woman's tragic tale: her parents' divorce leads her father to mistreat her, seeing her as a disgrace. He forces her to work in a factory, where she handles toxic substances without adequate protection. Desperate to escape her abusive father—who seizes almost all her earnings—she manages to save enough for her first mobile phone.</p>
    <p>Initially working as a technician, she realizes it's not lucrative, so she quits and turns to online streaming. Here, she submits to viewers' requests, performing outrageous acts for their entertainment. In one instance, she even obeys their command to relieve herself on a subway, all in pursuit of financial independence. Through these means, she astonishingly accrues enough wealth to afford a Ferrari. The audience cheers her on, some even misappropriating funds to support her.</p>
    <p>While her actions might seem extreme, consider her resilience in surviving such upbringing. Many wouldn't have endured. Her unyielding spirit is truly commendable.</p>
